## The Story Behind DEVAA: The Ultimate Mobile Security for Developers

## What is DEVAA?

![mobile-security](/static/images/mobile-security1.jpg)

Most of you might have heard the term "vulnerability" before. A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a software system that can be exploited by hackers to compromise your device, data, or privacy. Vulnerabilities can range from simple bugs to serious security holes that can allow attackers to take over your device, steal your personal information, or install malware on your device.

How can you protect yourself from these threats? One way is to use DEVAA, an open-source mobile security app that runs security scans on your mobile applications to identify vulnerable and malicious configurations or libraries.

DEVAA stands for Detecting Exploitable Vulnerabilities in Android Applications. It is a tool that analyzes the code and configuration of Android apps and detects any insecure or malicious components, such as outdated libraries, hard-coded credentials, insecure network connections, or embedded malware. DEVAA can scan both installed apps and APK files, and it provides a detailed report of the findings, along with recommendations on how to fix them in your dashboard.

DEVAA is more than just an app scanner. It is also a learning tool that provides mobile security education.

## How DEVAA was born?

![mobile-security-header](/static/images/mobile-security-header.jpg)

DEVAA is an app that was built by hackers for developers. After identifying and exposing many vulnerabilities in popular applications, we felt inspired to help the developersâ€™ community by automating security testing and vulnerability checks in mobile applications.

But who is behind this amazing app? Meet Shiva, a hacker and a mobile security expert who created DEVAA as his passion project. He has always been fascinated by hacking and security, and he wanted to automate the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in mobile applications. He also wanted to educate developers and users on how to build and use secure apps.

Shiva is not just a hacker, he is also a security engineer who has been working with mobile app security since 2015. He graduated with a Master of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, where he developed DEVAA as his thesis project. He is currently working to help organizations and developers improve their mobile security posture.

DEVAA is an open-source project that welcomes feedback and collaboration from the community. We have already released the Manifest scanner and dependency scanner as part of our application. Do try it out!
